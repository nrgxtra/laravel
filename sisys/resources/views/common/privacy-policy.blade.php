                            Future is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal
                            information whilst striving to provide the very best user experience.
                            We want our websites to be safe and enjoyable for everyone.
                            Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation 2021 (GDPR),
                            the Data Protection Act 2018 and related laws, we have a legal
                            duty to protect the personal information we collect from you.
                            GDPR says that ‘personal data’ is any information relating to a living
                            individual who can be identified, either directly or indirectly,
                            from that information. This could include your name, email address,
                            postal address or telephone number, or information collected online
                            and used to identify you.

                        </p>
                        For the purposes of GDPR, the ‘Data Controller’ for Future services based in the UK is

                        Australia it is Future Publishing (Overseas) Limited. As Data Controller we are
                        responsible for, and control, the processing of your personal data for the purposes of
                        Future’s services.

                            in order to process your personal data, we must have a lawful reason for doing so.
                            GDPR sets out six lawful bases under which organisations can collect,
                            use and store personal data. We rely on four of the lawful bases:
                            <br>
                            Necessary for the performance of a contract

                            If you are our customer, for example a subscriber of a magazine or an attendee at one of our
                            events,
                            we will process your personal data on the basis that it is necessary for us to provide

                            This is where you have actively agreed and ‘opted-in’, for example to receive marketing
                            communications from us,
                            and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

                            INTRODUCTION

                            This Cookies Policy explains how Future Publishing Limited, Future plc and their group
                            companies (“Future”) use cookies and similar technologies. Whenever you use Future’s
                            websites, apps, products, advertising services or other technologies (“Services”), or visit
                            a website, app or service which uses our Services, information may be collected through the
                            use of cookies and similar technologies. Future is committed to protecting the personal
                            information collected when you use our Services.

                            This Cookies Policy provides the following information for users:

                            What are cookies and similar technologies?
                            What are the different types of cookies?
                            What are cookies used for?
                            How does Future use cookies?
                            How can users manage or opt out of cookies?

                            WHAT ARE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES?

                            A cookie is a small data file, often including a unique identifier, which is sent to your
                            computer, mobile phone or tablet device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the
                            web server so the website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the
                            website. The cookie will collect information relating to your use of our Services,
                            information about your device, e.g. the device’s IP address and browser type, broad location
                            and, if you arrived at our site via a link from a third party site, the URL of the linking
                            page. If you have registered for any Services or you are a subscriber, it may also collect
                            your name and email address, which may be transferred to data processors for registered user
                            or subscriber verification purposes.

                            Similar technologies known as “local storage” may also be used in our Services as an
                            alternative to cookies. This is technology which is similar to cookies and performs very
                            similar functions, such as caching data to enable us to improve our Services, allowing you
                            to register for our Services, tracking activity to enable us and our advertisers to
                            advertise to you in accordance with this policy and counting the number of people who view
                            adverts on our Services. Where we refer to “cookies” in this policy, we mean cookies or
                            similar technologies.

                            Cookies record information about your online preferences and help us to tailor our Services
                            to your interests. Information provided by cookies can help us to analyse your use of our
                            Services and help us to provide you with a better user experience.

                            In addition to cookies, our Services may also use web beacons, clear GIFs, page tags and web
                            bugs. These are all types of technology implemented by websites or third party ad servers to
                            allow them to analyse your website use and help improve your experience of the Services.

                            WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COOKIES?

                            Session cookies are only stored for the duration of your visit to a website and are deleted
                            from your device when you close your browser;
                            Persistent cookies are saved on your device for a set period of time after the browser has
                            closed and are used where we (or a third party) need to identify you for a later browsing
                            session.
                            First party cookies are set by the website you are visiting; and
                            Third-party cookies are cookies used within our services which are set by other
                            organisations. These include cookies from external analytics services which help us to
                            understand the use of our sites, or by advertisers so that they can track the effectiveness
                            of their advertisements. Third-party cookies can also be set by selected social media
                            companies to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks, which may
                            impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit.
                            WHAT ARE COOKIES USED FOR?

                            Future, together with our trusted partners, uses cookies in combination with other
                            information we maintain for a number of purposes, including the following:

                            1. Essential or ‘Strictly Necessary’ Cookies

                            These cookies are essential for the running of our Services. Without these cookies, parts of
                            our websites would not function. These cookies do not track where you have been on the
                            internet and do not remember preferences beyond your current visit and do not gather
                            information about you that could be used for marketing purposes. These cookies are usually
                            session cookies which will expire when you close your browsing session.

                            2. Functional Cookies

                            Functional cookies are essential to the running of our Services. They are used to remember
                            your preferences on our websites and to provide enhanced, more personal features. The
                            information collected by these cookies is usually anonymised, so we cannot identify you
                            personally. Functional cookies do not track your internet usage or gather information which
                            could be used for selling advertising, but they do help with serving advertising. They may
                            be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our page.

                            3. Analytical Performance and Measurement Cookies

                            Analytical performance cookies are used to monitor the performance of our Services, for
                            example, to determine the number of pageviews and the number of unique users a website has.
                            Web analytics services may be designed and operated by third parties. The information
                            provided by these cookies allows us to analyse patterns of user behaviour and we use that
                            information to enhance user experience or identify areas of the website which may require
                            maintenance. The information is anonymous (i.e. it cannot be used to identify you and does
                            not contain personal information such as your name and email address) and it is only used
                            for statistical purposes.

                            4. Targeting or ‘Behavioural Advertising’ Cookies

                            These cookies, which may be placed on your device by us or our trusted third-party service
                            providers, remember that you have visited a website and use that information to provide you
                            with content or advertising which is tailored to your interests. This is often called online
                            behavioural advertising (OBA) and is done by grouping together shared interests based upon
                            web browsing history. Your web browsing history can be used to infer things about you (e.g.
                            your age, gender etc.), and this information may also be used to make advertising on
                            websites more relevant to you. Without these cookies, content and advertisements you
                            encounter may be less relevant to you and your interests. If you would like more information

                            5. Social Media Cookies

                            These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site
                            when you share our content with your friends and networks or when you engage with our
                            content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter. They are capable of
                            tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This
                            may impact the content and messages you see on other sites you visit.

                            HOW DOES FUTURE USE COOKIES?

                            Future, together with our trusted partners, uses cookies in combination with other
                            information we maintain for a number of purposes, including the following:

                            1. Essential and Functional Cookies

                            We use these cookies to enable certain online functionality including:

                            accessing your information so we can provide you with customised content and experiences, or
                            remember the last page you visited on the Services;
                            identifying returning users, registrants and subscribers and allow them to be presented with
                            a personalised version of the site;
                            eliminating the need for returning users to re-enter their login details;
                            commenting on our sites;
                            operating a shopping trolley on a variety of our Services including www.magazinesdirect.com;
                            maintaining your settings and authenticating your identity while you are logged in to the
                            Services;
                            to support security measures and to assist in identifying possible fraudulent or abusive
                            activities.
                            If you object to the use of essential and functional cookies please see here: How can users
                            manage or opt out of cookies?

                            2. Analytical Performance and Measurement Cookies

                            We use these cookies to measure users’ behaviour to better develop our Services. By using
                            analytics services provided by third parties such as Google Analytics and ComScore, we can
                            analyse and measure which pages are viewed and how long for and which links are followed,
                            and we can use this information to provide more content which is of interest. The data
                            collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business
                            analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics and to inform our advertising
                            and marketing strategies. Our cookies, or the resulting analysis, can also be shared with
                            our business partners. We also receive similar information about visitors to the sites of
                            our group companies and other partners.

                            If you object to the use of analytical performance and measurement cookies please see How
                            can users manage or opt out of cookies?

                            3. Targeting or ‘Behavioural Advertising’ Cookies

                            We use these cookies to:

                            deliver content and marketing communications tailored to your interests based on information
                            from your visit;
                            manage online advertising and revenue share arrangements. Our approved advertising partners,
                            primarily Google (Doubleclick and AdSense), Magnite, Index Exchange, OpenX, Pubmatic, Criteo
                            and GroupM use cookies together with web beacons to provide advertising to you and to enable
                            us to manage our relationship with those advertisers by, for example, tracking how many
                            unique users have seen a particular advertisement or followed a link in an advertisement;
                            manage eCommerce activities via affiliate links and associated revenue share arrangements;
                            measure general user behaviour across our sites and third party sites to build a profile
                            based on users’ browsing patterns so that we and third parties can target advertising to
                            users that will be more relevant to their interests. This means that if, for example, users
                            visit a page with a review about a particular camera then the cookie will collect this
                            information and we may target adverts for that camera to those users and, if users visit
                            third party sites that are part of the same advertising network, those third parties may
                            target adverts for that camera to those users;
                            to create profiles that trusted third parties can buy to allow them to better target their
                            advertising with more relevant content;
                            display relevant advertising to you on other sites, based on your web search activity;
                            keep track of the number of users who saw a particular ad or visited a particular page of
                            one of our websites, analyse the effectiveness of our ads, and provide auditing, research
                            and reporting for advertisers.
                            The trusted partners we work with in relation to targeting and behavioural advertising
                            include third-party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of advertisement
                            content, research firms and other companies that help us provide more effective advertising
                            and offer you a more personalised experience. As your browser, app or device communicates
                            with the third party’s servers, these companies can collect information, including your IP
                            address, page header information, browser or device information, just as if you had
                            requested their web page or used their apps directly.

                            We cannot control nor do we have access to any cookies placed on your computer by third
                            party advertisers and sponsors.

                            For more detailed information about the third parties who we work with on targeting and
                            behavioural advertising, please click here.

                            If you object to the use of targeting and behavioural advertising cookies please see How can
                            users manage or opt-out of cookies?

                            4. Social Media Cookies

                            Cookies are also used when you share information using a social media sharing button on the
                            sites. The social network will record that you have done this and may use this information
                            about your visit to target advertising to you. We also market our own products and services
                            on social media and use cookies to help with this. For example, we place a pixel on our
                            sites that allows Facebook to place cookies on web browsers. When a visitor to our site who
                            uses Facebook returns to Facebook, Facebook can identify them as part of a group of our site
                            visitors and can serve them with marketing messages from us on our behalf.

                            The types of cookies used by these third parties and how they use the information generated
                            by them will be governed by those companies’ privacy policies. If you object to the use of
                            social media cookies please see here: How can users manage or opt out of cookies?

                            5. Other Third Party Cookies

                            You may notice on some pages of our websites that cookies have been set that are not related
                            to Future. When you visit a page with content embedded from a third party service provider
                            such as YouTube, for example, they may set their own cookies on your device. Future does not
                            control the use of these third party cookies and cannot access them due to the way that
                            cookies work, as cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them. Please
                            check the third party websites for more information about these cookies.

                            Some of our websites use Adobe Flash Player to deliver video and game content to users.
                            Adobe utilise their own cookies, which are not manageable through your browser settings but
                            are used by the Flash Player for similar purposes, such as storing preferences or tracking
                            users. Flash Cookies work in a different way to web browser cookies; rather than having
                            individual cookies for particular jobs, a website is restricted to storing all data in one
                            cookie. You can control how much data, if any, may be stored in that cookie but you cannot
                            choose what type of information is allowed to be stored. You can manage which websites can
                            store information in Flash cookies on your device via the website storage settings panel on
                            the Adobe website.

                            We also include web beacons in our emails to track the success of our marketing campaigns.
                            This means that if you open an email from us we can see which of the pages of our websites
                            you have visited. Our web beacons do not store additional information on your device but, by
                            communicating with our cookies on your device, they can tell us whether our emails are
                            opened and verify any clicks through to links or advertisements. They enable us to query
                            whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them and to inform our
                            advertisers in aggregate how many users have clicked on their advertisements within the
                            email. We may also use this information for purposes including determining which of our
                            emails are more interesting to users and for personalising email campaigns.

                            If you object to the use of web beacons please see here: How can users manage or opt out of
                            cookies?

                            HOW CAN USERS MANAGE OR OPT-OUT OF COOKIES?

                            Some people find the idea of a website storing information on their device a little
                            intrusive, in particular when the information is stored and used by a third party. For
                            example, you may object to being served advertising which is targeted to your interests
                            based on your browsing history. If you would prefer to opt out of cookies, it is possible to
                            control cookies by following the steps below, however you should be aware that you might
                            lose some features and functionality of the website if you do so.

                            Cookies, including those which have already been set, can be deleted from your hard drive.
                            You can also change the preferences/settings in your web browser to control cookies. Some
                            internet browsers have a ‘Do Not Track or ‘DNT’ setting; this sends a signal to websites
                            asking them not to track your browsing. The following links may be helpful:
